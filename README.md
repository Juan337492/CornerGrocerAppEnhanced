# CornerGrocerAppEnhanced
CornerGrocerApp is a Java-based application that tracks and analyzes item purchase frequencies for a grocery store. This project demonstrates fundamental algorithmic principles and the efficient use of data structures, making it an ideal example of applying core computer science concepts to solve real-world problems.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Storage:**  
  Utilizes Java's `HashMap` to store and retrieve item frequencies, showcasing constant time complexity (O(1)) for insertion and lookup operations.
  
- **Algorithmic Processing:**  
  Reads input from a file, tokenizes the text, and processes the data using iterative algorithms to update frequency counts.
  
- **Item Lookup:**  
  Quickly retrieves the frequency of a specified item, demonstrating optimized data access.
  
- **Histogram Display:**  
  Visualizes data through a text-based histogram where each item's frequency is represented by a series of asterisks.
  
- **Interactive Menu:**  
  Provides a command-line interface that guides the user through various features, illustrating clear algorithmic flow and robust error handling.

## Relation to Algorithms and Data Structures

CornerGrocerApp is deeply rooted in the principles of algorithms and data structures:
- **Data Structures:**  
  The project leverages the `HashMap` to efficiently handle dynamic data storage and retrieval, a crucial concept in managing large datasets.
- **Algorithms:**  
  It implements fundamental algorithms for reading, parsing, and processing input data. The iterative approach to counting occurrences and generating a histogram demonstrates practical applications of algorithm design.
- **Efficiency:**  
  By using these techniques, the application not only solves a practical problem but also highlights the importance of selecting the right data structures and algorithms to achieve scalable and maintainable solutions.
